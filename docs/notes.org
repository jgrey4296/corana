* Multi-Pass Sieve for Coreference Resolution Notes (cite:Raghunathan2010)
** Candidate Selection
Sort list of candidates by:
1) Same Sentence, Left-To-Right BFS of trees
   (L2R favours subjects, BFS favours salience)
   (Repeat for each clause)
   2a) For nominal mentions:  Previous Sentence, Right-To-Left, BFS
   (Favours salience, and proximity)
   2b) For pronominal mentionals: Left-To-Right
   (Favours subjects)
** Attribute Union
Union all detected attributes of mentions
** Mention Selection
Per layer, Resolve only mentions first in textual order for cluster
** Search Pruning
Disable mentions starting with indefinite articles and pronouns
*Except* in the first pass
** Layers:
*** Exact Match
Including modifiers and determiners
*** Precise Constructs
1) Appositive constructions
   eg: [Israel's Deputy Defense Minister], [Ephraim Sneh], said...
2) Predicate nominative: copulative subject-object relation
   eg: [The New York-based College Board] is [a non profit organization]...
3) Role Appositive: Antecedent is headed by a noun and appears as a modifier in a NP
   eg: [[actress] Rebecca Schaeffer]
   Only if antecedent is animate, a person, and gender is defined.
4) Relative Pronoun
   eg: [the finance street [which] has already formed]
5) Acronym: Both mentions tagged as NNP and one is an acronym of the other
   eg: [Agence France Presse]... [AFP]
6) Demonym:
   eg: [Israel]... [Israeli]
*** Strict Head Matching
Match all in order to yield a link:
1) Match any head in antecedent cluster
2) Word Inclusion (all non-stop words)
   eg: intervene in the [Florida Supreme Court]'s move... by [the Florida court]...
3) Compatible modifiers only
   mentions modifiers are all included in modifiers of antecedent candidate
   only modifiers that are nouns or adjectives
4) Not I within I : Cannot be a child NP in the others NP constituent
*** Variants of Strict Head removing select constraints
*** Relaxed Head Matching
Allow mention head to match any word in the cluster of the candidate antecedent
eg: Sanders matches to cluster { Sauls, the judge, Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls }
Requires Mention and Antecedent be named entities of matching type
*** Pronouns
Enforce agreement on attributes:
1) Number / Plurality
2) Gender
3) Person (apart from within quotes)
4) Animacy
